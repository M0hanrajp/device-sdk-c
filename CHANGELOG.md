- 'minimum' and 'maximum' ValueProperties are effective.
- PUT commands on api/v2/device can read CBOR payloads as an alternative to JSON

  to a single address.

Changes for 1.2.1:

- Fixes in the compatibility layer for the v1 API.

Changes for 1.2.0 "Geneva":

- Full dynamic discovery implementation with Provision Watchers.
- New SDK API: see README.v2.md for details.
  - the v1 API will be removed in version 2.0.0
- Utility functions added in edgex-base.h for finding Protocol Properties, and
  for obtaining numeric values from name-value pair lists.

Changes for 1.1.0 "Fuji":

- ResourceOperation field "object" is renamed to "deviceResource".
  - "object" is still recognized for compatibility purposes but is deprecated.
- Implement "defaultValue" and "parameter" fields for write operations.
- Allow query strings to be passed to device GET requests.
- Added /api/version endpoint for obtaining service version strings.
- Commandline argument processing mostly handled within the SDK.

- Device services de-register from the registry on exit.
- Event timestamps are now at nanosecond resolution, and are monotonic.

Changes for 1.0.0 "Edinburgh":

- EnableLogging replaces RemoteURL in the Logging configuration. The location
  of the logging service is configured in the [Clients] section.
- Removed ReadMaxLimit configuration option.
- Events containing binary Readings are encoded using CBOR.
  - This introduces a dependency on libcbor.
- Data transformations (other than "mask") are applied for device PUT requests.
- When querying for Device Profiles they are returned in a list in the same way
  as devices.
- Device service now follows the new/start/stop/free lifecycle pattern.
- Initial support for configuration changes without restarting.
- Support Correlation IDs. This introduces a requirement for libUUID.
- The API for Event generation other than via device GET requests is split out
  into a seperate header edgex/eventgen.h
- Added support for Automatic Events.
- The API for managing devices and profiles is split out into a seperate header
  edgex/device-mgmt.h
- The device name is passed to the Get and Set handlers. The commandrequest
  structure is simplified.
- Example implementation includes setting service name and registry location
  from the command line and environment.
- Float data is marshalled as base64 unless specified otherwise in the
  floatEncoding field of the device profile.
- Schedules and ScheduleEvents are removed.
- The get and set handlers now take an edgex_protocols object rather than an
  edgex_addressable.
- The device endpoint can be used to access either resources or deviceResources.
  The commands section of a device profile is not used.
- Endpoints for other EdgeX microservices are obtained from the registry (if
  enabled) rather than configuration.
- Metadata for individual devices can be obtained in the device management API.
- The edgex_deviceobject type is renamed to edgex_deviceresource to reflect its
  naming in the profile definition.
- The registry service is now identified by a URL, eg "consul://localhost:8500".
  - Support for consul as the registry service is built-in, but other
    implementations may be added using the API in edgex/registry.h
- Support EdgeX System Management API.
- Initial support for binary data, marshalled as base64 strings.
- Assertions on data readings are implemented.
- Some parts of the edgex model are now held in appropriate types rather
  than strings.
  - edgex_device_resulttype is renamed to edgex_propertytype, reflecting its
    broader usage.

Changes for 0.7.2:

- Device GET commands return Event structures rather than name-value pairs.

Changes for 0.7.1:

- Some verification on Device Profiles is now done at startup. This may result
  in failures during startup rather than in "device" command handling.
- The /device/name/{name}/{command} REST endpoint is implemented.
- Metadata callbacks for device creation and deletion are processed.

Changes for 0.7.0 "Delhi":

- Consul is supported for registration and configuration.
  - New configuration option Service.CheckInterval controlling how frequently
    the registry polls the device service for liveliness.
  - Driver init functions get their configuration as a name-value pair list
    rather than a TOML table.
  - SDK start function now takes parameters for Consul's hostname and port. They
    are no longer included in the configuration file.

- "Discovery", "DataTransform" and "ReadMaxLimit" configuration options are now effective.
- "OpenMsg" option replaced by "StartupMsg" for consistency with other services.
